## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this website.

This is a website coded based on a tutorial video on Bottstrap 5 made by *Brad Traversy*

Here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s) to the video.

Brad is a tutor who teaches anything that has to do with software development and he's very wonderful at what he does.

## The website

Built majorly with Bootsrap 5, the website includes wonderful bootstrap features such as;
1. Navbar and the toggle feature.
2. Bootstrap Flex and Grid features.
3. Accordion Feature.
4. Bootstrap Icons

Also, an external CSS file was used to modify some stylings to get better out. 

[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) was used to create a map in the **Contact Section**



## Deploying the project

The website was deployed on Netlify: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
